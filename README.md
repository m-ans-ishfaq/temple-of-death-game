## Game Description
The game is set in a 2D maze, viewed from a side-scrolling perspective, and is divided into two segments: the Temple and the Boss Arena. The Temple features a labyrinth with challenges like burners and chests that require fire to open. Items are collected upon player collision, while contact with enemy projectiles decreases health. Running out of health results in a game over. Players shoot based on their weapon's gauge, which increases over time as stamina is recovered. Different weapons have varying gauge requirements. The player's score rises with interactions such as chest destruction, item collection, and hitting enemies with bullets. The primary objective is to collect scrolls while surviving.
The Boss Arena comprises a bordered area with a weakened seal at the center. Upon spotting the player, the devil initiates random moves, generating obstacles that players must evade while causing damage to the central seal. Once the boss's health is depleted, the devil is sealed, and the player successfully completes the game.
## Background Story
A long time ago, the Devil used to make a lot of trouble, but then four Spirit Magicians sealed him away, bringing peace to the world. Everything was fine until a creepy pool of blood showed up in a temple. The four magicians were found dead with a note saying the Earth would meet the Devil again. People who study spooky stuff thought the magicians might have turned into the Devil to destroy everything.
Only the original four magicians knew where the Devil was sealed, and the temple where they died had a bunch of secrets. Even though many folks tried to figure things out, nobody ever came back. The temple got famous as the 'Temple of Death,' a place where bad things happened, and people who tried to uncover its secrets never made it out.

| 👾 Player      | The player is a daring human with magical gloves, allowing them to shoot various projectiles. Their mission is to escape the deadly temple, which has claimed the lives of many adventurers before. The fate of the player in the temple of death is uncertain.                   |
| 🗡️ Barbarian   | Barbarians patrol a given horizontal range quickly, armed with a spear. Brainwashed by the devil, they protect the temple's secrets at all costs. A spear hit from a barbarian results in a drop in the player's health.                                                |
| 🎯 Archer      | Archers, clones of the devil, appear at random locations, facing a specific direction, and shoot arrows at different rates. They guard chests and block the player's path, posing a threat with their deadly arrows.                                                   |
| 🧙 Magicians   | The origin of magicians is unknown, but they are believed to be the evil spirits of four magicians who sealed the devil. These ghostly magicians throw magical orbs, adding another layer of challenge to the player's journey through the temple.                                  |
| 💣 Bombers     | Bombers, also devil clones, are summoned in the boss arena. They chase the player and explode upon getting too close, causing damage and sacrificing themselves. These explosive foes are a formidable challenge in certain parts of the game.                                |
| 👹 Devil       | The devil itself never appears, but its actions and noises emanate from the seal in the boss arena. The transmutation circle with four moves signifies the devil's attempts to hinder the player. Before being spotted, the devil weakened the seal, preparing for a showdown in the arena. |
## Game Objects
Game objects can be divided into three categories; hard objects, collectibles and projectiles. Hard objects are static through which no other object can pass through. Collectibles are also hard objects but the player can collect them, also known as “items”. Projectiles are dynamic objects, which can collide with characters or other hard objects.
